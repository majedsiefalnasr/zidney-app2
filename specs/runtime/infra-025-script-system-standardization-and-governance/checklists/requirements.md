# Specification Quality Checklist: Script System Standardization and Governance

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Validation iteration:** 1 of 1 — passed on first review.

**Key design decisions documented:**

- Naming convention (`<domain>:<action>[:<scope>]`) is fully specified with domain map
- Refactor engine behavior (dry-run, idempotency, scan scope) is described at the outcome level without prescribing TypeScript implementation details
- CI integration requirements list the four gate checks by name
- Constitutional compliance declaration confirms this is an infrastructure-only stage with no impact on runtime trust chain
- Non-goals section explicitly bounds scope to prevent drift into business-logic changes
